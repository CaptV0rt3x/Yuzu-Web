Welcome to the Quickstart Guide!

To start playing commercial games, yuzu needs a couple of system files and folders from your switch in order to play them properly.
This guide will help you copy all your system files, games, updates, and DLC from your switch to your computer and organize them in a format yuzu understands. 

This process should take about 60 to 90 minutes.

To check if your Switch is hackable, visit <https://damota.me/ssnc/checker> and test your Switch's serial number.

But first, we must determine whether your computer meets the following hardware requirements for running yuzu.

## Hardware Requirements

Our recommended specifications don't guarantee perfect performance in most games, but rather strive to provide a cost effective recommendation while still considering performance.

| Component 	| Minimum                                                                               			| Recommended                                                                                  			|

| GPU       	| Intel HD Graphics 520 <br> or <br>NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 2GB<br> or <br>AMD Radeon R7 240 2GB 	| Intel UHD Graphics 630 <br> or <br>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 4GB <br> or <br>AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 8GB 	|
| RAM       	| 8 GB                                                                                  			| 16 GB                                                                                        			|

  <div class="message-body" style="color:#fff;">
	<li>Most games are playable on older Nvidia GPUs from the Fermi family (400 series) or later, but at least Pascal (1000 series) is strongly recommended.</li>
	<br>
	<li>CPUs lacking the FMA instruction set will produce very poor results. Intel Core gen 3 series or older, AMD phenom II or older and all Pentium/Celeron/Atom CPUs will not produce optimal results.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Laptop CPUs will not reach the same performance as their desktop counterparts due to thermal, power, and technical limitations.</li>
